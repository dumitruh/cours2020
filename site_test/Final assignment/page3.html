            <h1>Cigar</h1>
            <p>A cigar is a rolled bundle of dried and fermented tobacco leaves made to be smoked. They are produced in
                a
                wide variety
                of sizes and shapes. Since the 20th century, almost all cigars are made up of three distinct components:
                the
                filler, the
                binder leaf which holds the filler together, and a wrapper leaf, which is often the best leaf used.
                Often
                the cigar will
                have a band printed with the cigar manufacturer's logo. Modern cigars often come with 2 bands,
                especially
                Cuban Cigar
                bands, showing Limited Edition (Edición Limitada) bands displaying the year of production.</p>
            <p>Cigar tobacco is grown in significant quantities primarily in Central America and the islands of the
                Caribbean,
                including Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Panama,
                and
                Puerto Rico;
                it is also produced in the Eastern United States, the Mediterranean countries of Italy and Spain (in the
                Canary
                Islands), and in Indonesia and the Philippines of Southeast Asia.</p>
            <p>The origins of cigar smoking are unknown. A Mayan ceramic pot from Guatemala dating back to the 10th
                century
                depicts
                people smoking tobacco leaves tied with a string.</p> <br><br>

            <h3>Cohiba Puro Dominicana</h3>
            Cohiba is easily one of the most recognized names in the cigar industry. Today, Cuban Cohiba's are not
            available in the
            United States, but their popular Dominican blends are created using the same methods incorporated in Cuba,
            which is why
            the brand continues to strive as one of the top 5 brands in the industry. Each cigar is perfectly bunched
            and
            constructed to allow for a proper burn and draw, every time, while only utilizing the best tobaccos
            available for
            blending.
            Cohiba Puro Dominicana sports an oily Dominican-grown, natural wrapper which is seamlessly constructed and
            very toothy.
            Underneath, 100% Dominican fillers are selected from the best portions of each plant grown in some of the
            most fertile
            soil. In order to create an oak-like flavor mixed with subtle spices, each hand of tobacco was aged ‘en
            tercio' in
            charcoal-ed wooden barrels. This process creates a unique flavor unlike any other. Cohiba Puro Dominicana is
            additionally aged once constructed, which allows the tobaccos to properly marry, creating a smooth,
            well-balanced,
            complex puro that will fail to disappoint even the most discerning cigar enthusiast. <br>

            <h3>Rocky Patel Decade</h3>
            Rocky Patel is known for his impeccable attention to detail, which is why his cigars are so consistent in
            construction
            and flavor, since he puts a massive amount of time and effort into quality assurance. All of his cigars go
            through
            rigorous tests ensuring only the best sticks reach consumers. In addition Rocky is known for his blending
            abilities,
            creating cigars uniquely different from each other, all of which utilize the best tobaccos currently
            available at the
            time of creation. You will not find two different Rocky Patel brands that taste the same. Decade remains on
            a pedestal
            of its own. Although Rocky earned many accolades for his cigars, including 90+ ratings for his Vintage
            lines, Decade is
            now his cream of the crop. This beauty features a dark, oily Sumatra wrapper that masks a unique Honduran
            blend of long
            leaves in the filler. Potent, very rich, smooth, creamy, yet powerful with a medium finish, this cigar is
            honestly one
            of the finest blends on the market—well deserving of its '95' rating by Cigar Aficionado.

            <h3>Alec Bradley Prensado</h3>
            Sporting a unique 2006 Corojo wrapper, Prensado was completely built around its limited, Honduran-grown
            wrapper leaf and
            earned a whopping 96 points by Cigar Aficionado in addition to #1 Cigar of the Year Honors for 2011.<br>
            Alec Bradley Prensado comes box-pressed and features a fantastic blend of Nicaraguan and Honduran premium
            long-leaf
            tobaccos. The blend burns slow, even, and exudes flavorful nuances of chocolate mixed with toasty notes of
            leather and
            earth. The first inch will leave an intense, spicy character on your palate before slightly mellowing out by
            delivering
            some sweet notes that are to die for. Enjoy this full-bodied blend in the afternoon or after your favorite
            meal.

            <h3>Macanudo Cafe</h3>
            Celebrated for its subtle body and mellow flavor, as well as its incomparable consistency - Macanudo is the
            top-selling
            cigar brand in the U.S.

            Since its inception, this beloved cigar brand has taken up permanent residence in humidors everywhere due to
            its
            unparalleled construction and pleasantly mellow taste. General Cigar originally made Macanudo in Jamaica,
            but due to the
            adverse conditions moved production to the Dominican Republic, where it remains to this day. <br>
            Combining a Connecticut Shade wrapper, Dominican fillers, and a unique binder grown in the San Andrés Valley
            of Mexico,
            the Macanudo is fairly straight-forward and light in flavor with a very short finish. Macanudo is the cigar
            that put
            General Cigar Co. on the map, and has led to their unprecedented success. Still on top as the best-seller,
            the name
            Macanudo is one of the most recognizable in world. Nowhere else can such consistency be found in a cigar.
            This blend is
            ideal for those enthusiasts who are just getting started or those veterans who don’t like an overwhelming
            level of
            flavor or body.
