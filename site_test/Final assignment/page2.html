            <h1>Whisky</h1>
            <img src="img whisky/whisky-tasting.jpg" class="img1">
            <p><b>Whisky</b> or <b>whiskey</b> is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash.
                Various grains <em>(which may be
                    malted)</em> are used for different varieties, including barley, corn, rye, and wheat. Whisky is
                typically aged in wooden
                casks, generally made of charred white oak.
            </p>

            <p>Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying
                characteristics of the
                different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels.
            </p>
            <br> <br>
            <h2>Names and spellings</h2>
            <p>Much is made of the word's two spellings: whisky and whiskey. There are two schools of thought on the
                issue.
                One is that the spelling difference is simply a matter of regional language convention for the spelling
                of a
                word,
                indicating that the spelling varies depending on the intended audience or the background or personal
                preferences of the
                writer (like the difference between color and colour; or recognize and recognise), and the other is that
                the
                spelling should depend on the style or origin of the spirit being described. There is general agreement
                that
                when
                quoting the proper name printed on a label, the spelling on the label should not be altered.</p>
            <p>The spelling whiskey is common in Ireland and the United States, while whisky is used in all other
                whisky-producing
                countries. In the US, the usage has not always been consistent. From the late eighteenth century to the
                mid
                twentieth
                century, American writers used both spellings interchangeably until the introduction of newspaper style
                guides. Since
                the 1960s, American writers have increasingly used whiskey as the accepted spelling for aged grain
                spirits
                made in the
                US and whisky for aged grain spirits made outside the US. However, some prominent American brands, such
                as
                George
                Dickel, Maker's Mark, and Old Forester (all made by different companies), use the whisky spelling on
                their
                labels, and
                the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits, the legal regulations for spirit in the US, also use
                the
                whisky
                spelling throughout.</p>

            <h3>Types</h3>
            <p>Whisky or whisky-like products are produced in most grain-growing areas. They differ in base product,
                alcoholic content,
                and quality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Malt whisky is made primarily from malted barley.</li>
                <li>Grain whisky is made from any type of grain</li>.
            </ul>

            <h4>Malts and grains are combined in various ways:</h4>
            <p><span><b>Single malt whisky</b></span> is whisky from a single distillery made from a mash that uses only
                one
                particular malted grain.
                Unless the whisky is described as single-cask, it contains whisky from many casks, and different years,
                so
                the blender
                can achieve a taste recognisable as typical of the distillery. In most cases, single malts bear the name
                of
                the
                distillery, with an age statement and perhaps some indication of some special treatments, such as
                maturation
                in a port
                wine cask.</p>
            <p><span><b>Blended malt whisky</b> </span>is a mixture of single malt whiskies from different distilleries.
                If a
                whisky is labelled "pure
                malt" or just "malt" it is almost certainly a blended malt whisky. This was formerly called a "vatted
                malt"
                whisky.</p>
            <p><span><b>Blended whisky</b></span> is made from a mixture of different types of whisky. A blend may
                contain
                whisky
                from many distilleries so
                that the blender can produce a flavour consistent with the brand. The brand name may, therefore, omit
                the
                name of a
                distillery. Most Scotch, Irish and Canadian whisky is sold as part of a blend, even when the spirits are
                the
                product of
                one distillery, as is common in Canada. American blended whisky may contain neutral spirits.</p>
            <p><span><b>Cask strength</b></span> (also known as barrel proof) whiskies are rare, and usually only the
                very best
                whiskies are bottled in
                this way. They are bottled from the cask undiluted or only lightly diluted.</p>
            <p><span><b>Single cask</b></span> (also known as single barrel) whiskies are bottled from an individual
                cask, and
                often the bottles are
                labelled with specific barrel and bottle numbers. The taste of these whiskies may vary substantially
                from
                cask to cask
                within a brand.</p>

                    Voted "World Whisky of the Year" for four out of the past seven years, Ardbeg's distillery has
                    remained
                    on the small
                    remote island of Islay for more than 200 years. The combination of the island's soft water, lush
                    soil,
                    and large supply
                    of peat– the soil byproduct which is burned in the distilling process, leaving the Scotch with its
                    smokey flavor– has
                    made it a favorite among single malt connoisseurs. Rich and with a smokey body, the 10 year aged
                    single
                    malt scotch
                    whisky will leave you with the taste of licorice, coffee, and tobacco.

                    Honoring Scotland's national poet, Robert Burns, Arran released a scotch whisky in his name.
                    Distilled on the small
                    island of Arran and made with water from the Loch na Davie– the pure and aromatic liquor will strike
                    you with notes of
                    honey, fruits, and toffee-glazed pecans. Made with the intention of easy drinking, the single malt
                    can be enjoyed either
                    on the rocks or neat.

                    Celebrated by Scotch-lovers for it's long and lingering finish, Johnnie Walker Gold Label is made
                    from a blend of
                    whiskies from the Speyside and Highland regions. The blend comes together as a smooth whisky full of
                    vanilla and dark
                    fruit.

                    Ballantine's Finest was created in 1910 and is blended with both single malt, grain, and highly
                    matured whiskies to give
                    you a slightly vanilla flavor. Fun fact, the Ballantine's square bottle originated during
                    prohibition so Americans could
                    conceal the bottles in their briefcases.

                    When the British government began taxing the Scottish distilleries, many of them began producing
                    whisky underground.
                    Glenlivet was one of the premier illicit distilleries, so much so that when King George IV visited
                    Scotland on a state
                    visit he demanded to try an illegal dram of the Scotch. The iconic brand has never ceased producing
                    top quality single
                    malt and the 15 Year Old bottle, with it's lingering sweet almond finish, is a prime example of
                    such.

                    Kilchoman is a farm distillery, which means it grows and harvests the barley on site. As a fairly
                    new distillery, it
                    opened in 2005, it has quickly made a name for itself as the only farm distillery on Islay. The
                    limited edition release
                    of the Sauternes Cask Finish spent months maturing in ex-bourbon and ex-wine casks before being
                    bottled to pair the
                    island's classic peat flavors with buttery, floral notes.
