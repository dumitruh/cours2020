            <h1>5 best watches to invest in right now</h1>
            <p>If you're looking to buy a watch that looks great and will hold its value (or, potentially even rise in
                value), you've
                come to the right place.</p>

            <p>It's a question we've heard often: what watch brands will increase in value over time?
                There's a short and simple answer: Rolex or Patek Philippe. But there's also a longer version, which
                we've answered here
                with the help of Rox Jewellers.</p>

            <p>Rox has recently carried out some research into the art of luxury watchmaking, with an aim to highlight
                the sheer level
                of effort and craftsmanship that goes into creating the world's most sought after timepieces.
                It identified three pillars of watch investment: brand recognition, demand, and rarity.
                Taking these three pillars into account, and with advise from watch experts and industry professionals,
                Rox created a
                list of the five best watches to invest in right now.</p>

                <h2>1. TUDOR HERITAGE BLACK BAY</h2>
                <img src="img watch/2j823Yont5FcE3ZJ5N9xc7-1366-80.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>A new addition to the Heritage Black Bay family this diver's watch in stainless steel draws its
                characteristic elements
                from Tudor's history. Fitted with Tudor's MT5602 self-winding mechanical movement with bidirectional
                rotor system, with
                power reserve of 70 hours.</p>
            <h3>What the expert says:</h3>
            <p>"Stick to the classic pieces that people will always want and you'll have a watch that, 10 years down the
                line, will
                recoup the majority of your initial outlay. Tudor's recent phoenix-from-the-ashes revival was
                spearheaded by the
                gorgeously but not slavishly retro-styled Black Bay.</p>

            <p>Now it's fitted with an in-house movement and always in steel, rather than precious metal (flamboyance
                is inversely
                proportional to successful investment!) It's already a classic that feels like it's always been around.
            </p>
            <h2>2. ROLEX SUBMARINER</h2>
            <img src="img watch/Rolex.jpg">
            <p>The iconic Rolex Submariner is one of the most successful diver’s watches in history. The Rolex
                Manufacture 3135
                movement is housed in a 904L stainless steel case which is waterproof to 300 metres (1,000 feet)</p>

            <h3>What the expert says:</h3>
            <p>"Rolex's steel sports watches are a surefire investment, you never see examples older than two or three
                years selling
                for less than what they originally cost. That's because Rolex is the ultimate luxury watch brand, their
                Submariner was
                the pioneering diving watch of the 1950s and you can wear it every day with everything."</p>

            <p> - Simon de Burton, watch and auction expert</p>
            <p>Now it's fitted with an in-house movement and always in steel, rather than precious metal (flamboyance is
                inversely
                proportional to successful investment!) It's already a classic that feels like it's always been around."

            <h2>3. AUDEMARS PIGUET ROYAL OAK AUTOMATIC</h2>
            <img src="img watch/Audemars.jpg">
            <p>The Royal Oak is made up of 280 parts and 40 jewels, this watch is powered by a self-winding manufacture
                calibre 3120
                movement and has a 60-hour power reserve.</p>
            <h3>What the expert says:</h3>
            <p>"The Royal Oak has barely changed since 1972 and for good reason - its designer Gérald Genta's octagonal
                case and
                integrated bracelet was spot-on from inception. That sort of integrity will come to bear in a lifetime's
                value, both
                sentimental and monetary."</p>

            <h2>4. OMEGA SEAMASTER 300M</h2>
            <img src="img watch/Omega.jpg">
            <p>This Seamaster 300 has a sand-blasted black dial with rhodium-plated hands coated with "vintage"
                Super-LumiNova. The polished ceramic bezel ring has a Liquidmetal diving scale, and the transparent
                caseback makes it possible to see the anti-magnetic OMEGA Master Co-Axial calibre 8400 within.</p>
            <h3>What the expert says: </h3>
            <p>"Buy into James Bond's model of choice and you'll be buying into a brand that's increasing in resale
                value
                faster than anyone else. What's more, if you look hard enough, you'll still be able to find the quartz
                version
                of the Seamaster, which is being phased out very soon. Discontinued watches are very collectable
                and you will undoubtedly reap more on the vintage market than what you sowed at retail."</p>
            <h2>5. PANERAI LUMINOR BASE</h2>
            <img src="img watch/Panerai.jpg">
            <p>The Panerai Luminor Base features a hand-wound Panerai OP I calibre, with a 56 hour power reserve.
                It's designed it Italy, but made in Switzerland.</p>
            <h3>What the expert says: </h3>
            <p>"Panerai's chunky, cushion-shaped watches are a modern cult phenomenon and one of the best investments
                you can make.
                Panerai has a fantastic collector base and, even if it's just to make a slight change,
                every model is limited, so whatever Panerai you buy will become a collectable soon enough." </P>
